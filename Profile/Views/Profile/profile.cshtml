        <h6>Autobiography</h6>
        <p>
           <span class="tab">Hi, I am Jacob Ramsey-Smith.<br /> I am from Marshalltown, IA. I lived there for 18 years before moving to Ames for school.</span>
            Some activities I did while I was there would include: Band, Choir, Environthon, Boy Scouts, Cross Country, Tennis, Robotics Club, and IT Olympics.
            In what little free time I had from those activites, I would usually hop on a video game such as DOTA 2 or maybe play some Magic: the Gathering with my friends.<br/>
            <span class="tab">After moving to Ames and starting life at ISU I slowed down on the extracurriculars and focused more on school.</span> 
            Eventually becoming more adjusted to the school life I joined a school coding club and the stock investment club.
            It was around this time that I got my first co-op at Marshalltown Company. I worked there for the summer and fall of 2018.
            Working there was a great expirience and I really got a good chance to extend my coding knowledge. A few projects I worked on
            while I was there was developing a cookie policy page as well as informing the user that the site kept cookies. I also helped
            set up the emailing system for their e-commerce site. It required implementing mail chimp (a 3rd party program
            that helps businesses send out emails). I had to do this in a manner that was effective while intuitive so it
            would fit into the new redesign of the streamlined e-commerce site.<br/>
            <span class="tab">I also enjoyed working with the other interns they hired there and I set up a weekly lunch for us. It was a good way</span>
            to get to know each other better and also a good chance to show them around Marshalltown a little bit.
            This was also the fall that the tornado came through Marshalltown. My family and I were lucky enough to
            hardly be affected by it. The Marshalltown Company building somehow hardly sustained any damage even
            though it was only  about a block away from the tornado!. Some people at work had some damage done to
            there home properties though. So the next day, everyone at work was encouraged to go help someone clean out their yards.
